PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a browser-based CPU Scheduling Simulator that supports multiple scheduling algorithms including:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
SJF (Shortest Job First)
SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
Round Robin
Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

It allows users to add custom processes with arrival and burst times, configure time quantum and allotments (for RR and MLFQ), and visualize execution using an animated Gantt chart. The interface also displays individual and average process performance metrics.


HOW TO RUN THE SIMULATION
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in any modern web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
Use the input fields to:

Add processes

Choose scheduling algorithm

Configure time quantum or MLFQ levels (if applicable)

Click "Run Simulation" to visualize the scheduling.

No server or installation needed. Works entirely in the browser.
